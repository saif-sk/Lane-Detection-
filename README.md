Lane Detection
Lane detection is a crucial computer vision task in autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). It involves identifying and tracking lane markings on roads to help vehicles stay in the correct lane and navigate safely. This is typically achieved using image processing and machine learning techniques applied to video footage captured by onboard cameras.

Key Concepts:
Edge Detection: Techniques like Canny edge detection are commonly used to identify lane boundaries by detecting sharp changes in pixel intensity.
Hough Transform: A method used to detect lines in the image by transforming pixels into a parameter space.
Region of Interest (ROI): Only specific regions of an image, such as the lower half where the road is located, are processed to improve performance.
Deep Learning: More advanced systems use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically learn lane features from large datasets, improving accuracy in complex environments.
Applications:
Autonomous Vehicles
